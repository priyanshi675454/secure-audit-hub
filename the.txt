Solana Audit Subsidy Program - Cohort V Applications by February 7th!

The Solana Audit Subsidy Program is a $1M initiative designed to lower barriers for Solana projects seeking security audits from high-quality, pre-vetted auditors. The program is a joint initiative between leading audit firms, key Solana ecosystem stakeholders (Superteam, MonkeDAO, Jito), and Areta Market as the infrastructure partner.

Following four successful cohorts with selected projects receiving subsidies ranging from $5k-$50k, the Solana Audit Subsidy Program is accepting applications for Cohort V until February 7th, 2026.


How It Works
Application: Projects apply via both the Subsidy Program Application Form and the Earn platform. Applications from Earn will be automatically matched to the general application form.

On the Earn platform, make sure you add your website or X profile (whichever link can help us get the most info about your project) in the “Link to the Submission” field.

Assessment: An expert panel comprised of Superteam, MonkeDAO, Jito, and Areta evaluates applications against a standardized rubric.

Approval & Subsidy: Qualified projects receive a subsidy amount and are onboarded to the marketplace.

Marketplace: Projects receive offers from participating audit providers.

Redemption: When selecting quotes, participating projects can apply their subsidy to any offer on the marketplace with up to 30% coverage of costs.

Redemption: Projects apply their Subsidy Voucher Code when selecting an offer
